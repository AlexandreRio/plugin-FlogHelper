Please, if you wanna add some code to FlogHelper, follow these very simple rules :

* Do not leave trailing spaces / tabulations.
* Always leave an empty line at each end of file.
* Use tabulations. DON'T CONVERT TABS TO SPACES !
* Use Unix-style line-endings. \n only !
* Always try to respect the pre-existing indentation style & naming conventions.
* Use lines with less than 80 chars when possible.

Thanks.
